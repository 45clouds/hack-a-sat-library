# HACK-A-SAT RESOURCE LIBRARY

A collection of Resources for budding SAT hackers (Satellites, not the test¯\_(ツ)_/¯). *Note: This is an evolving resource, so please [contribute](./HASlibrary-contribute-instrxns.md) with a pull request*

## BACKGROUND
 
The democratization of space has opened up a new frontier for exploration and innovation.  But with this opportunity, new cybersecurity vulnerabilities are also being created. One human can design, build and launch a satellite, adhering to very few standards and security protocols. So how can we achieve safe, reliable and trustworthy operations to truly realize the promise of space?  ...BY HACKING A SATELLITE.

The United States Air Force, in conjunction with the Defense Digital Service, presents this year’s Space Security Challenge, Hack-A-Sat. This challenge asks hackers from around the world to focus their skills and creativity on solving cybersecurity challenges on space systems... THE QUESTION IS, HOW?
